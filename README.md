# Rougemine.com - online resume

What could be more pleasant than totally over-engineering your online resume when you're a Web Developer in 2017 ?

[The previous version](https://github.com/DrBenton/rougemine.com-online-resume/tree/php-version) was based on PHP, 
[the version before](https://github.com/DrBenton/rougemine.com-online-resume/tree/v1) on Node.js, CoffeeScript, Vagrant and gulp (2013! :-).  
For this one I opted for a "full React" setup - including static files rendering. Sure, we have the great [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to bootstrap a React project without pain, but I wanted to experiment things manually.

So, in order to generate only 2 HTML pages and 2 PDF files, I had the pleasure to use the following technologies:
 * A Node.js tiny app to dump the content of my previous versions to 2 JSON files (one for each language). It uses "*.mjs" files, usable in the Node.js world thanks to [@std/esm](https://github.com/standard-things/esm) at the moment.
 * A React app, powered by a classic Webpack+Babel configuration. Because this CV has to be over-engineered by tradition, Redux is here of course.  
 For this app Webpack generates a JS file, CSS and img assets, and a "index.html" file as well.
 * A "React Server Side Rendering" Node.js app, powered by its own Webpack configuration - we need Babel and its friends to be able to render stuff like ECMAscript Modules or JSX in Node.js.  
 This app is reponsible for the generation of complete "index.en.html" and "index.fr.html" files from the "index.html" generated by Webpack for the React app. 

Is it really over-engineered?
```
$ ll node_modules/ | wc -l
823
```
Yes it is! 

## Usage
