In order to add shiny icons to my resume,
As a Web developer without any graphics skill,
I used third-party icons found on the Web.


I did not made these icons, and I don't have any permission to use them.

Given they are almost all Open Source projects icons, and that I don't make money with this resume,
I included them in the repository.

Don't hesitate to contact me if you own one of these icons and want me to remove it! <olivier@rougemine.com>
